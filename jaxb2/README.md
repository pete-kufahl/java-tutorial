# JAXB Tutorial
This project contains packages that correspond to the lessons in the *Working with XML in Java Using JAXB 2* course on Pluralsight.

## contents
### xml-example
* jaxb1 - marshalling / unmarshalling using JAXB, StAX
* jaxb2 - JAXB annotations
* jaxb3 - dealing with List collections
* jaxb4 - dealing with Map collections
* jaxb5 - converting a java Map to an XML List with an Adapter

### schemaexample
* jaxb6 - generate a .xsd schema
* jaxb7 - marshalling with nillable elements
* jaxb8 - more control over nillable behavior with ObjectFactory
* jaxb9 - generate classes from a schema
  * redone with maven plugin and simple .xsd in src/main/resources/
<details>
<summary>steps</summary>
* before writing the marshalling and unmarshalling java classes, put the .xsd into the resources/demo9/
* `mvn clean compile`
* copy over the generated classes from the target/... directory, if needed
* fix the base data type `PurchaseOrderType` to have a root element: `@XmlRootElement(name = "PurchaseOrder")`
* write the marshalling and unmarshalling classes
* marshalling -> generates a target XML file
* unmarshalling -> populates java objects from the XML file and the generated classes
* unmarshalling with validation -> uses the .xsd schema to validate the XML before unmarshalling
</details>

### advanced
* jaxb10 - validate against .xsd during both marshalling and unmarshalling
<details>
  <summary>steps</summary>
  * define .xsd in resources/demo10/
  * modify pom.xml to use this .xsd and place the generated classes in a advanced.jaxb10.domain package
  * copy generated classes in main/java/com/advanced/
  * fix the base data type `PurchaseOrderType` to have a root element: `@XmlRootElement(name = "PurchaseOrder")`
  * enter code for, build and run MarshallingExample
    * this creates a PurchaseOrder object and validates it against the schema
    * then, generates XML
  * enter code for, build and run UnmarshallingExample
    * like before, this reads in the XML and validates it against the schema
* jaxb11 - use Binder to maintain a DOM tree
  * unmarshal an XML document into a DOM tree
  * apply some changes to the DOM (e.g., add an element)
  * bind the modified DOM back to Java objects using the Binder
    * avoids the `@XmlRootElement` exception: no direct marshalling of the DOM element: We marshal the Java object (`PurchaseOrderType`), which doesnâ€™t require `@XmlRootElement`.
    * also, the Binder is only used for DOM to Java object transformation
      * The Binder is applied in this scenario where the XML is being manipulated at the DOM level, and we then convert it to a Java object. This avoids marshalling a DOM element without a root.
</details>

## caveats
* this was implemented on Java 17 SE JDK, which does not include JAXB in its standard distribution. JAXB was added as dependencies in maven.
* the tools schemagen and xjc are apparently no longer readily available
  * jaxb6 is a workaround for the lack of schemagen
  * the maven plugin `jaxb2-maven-plugin` replaces xjc
