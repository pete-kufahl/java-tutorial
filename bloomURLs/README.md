Fast URL Blacklisting with Bloom Filters

## project goals
*Create a system that quickly checks if a given URL is on a blacklist using a Bloom filter. This project will demonstrate how Bloom filters help in optimizing large-scale membership testing with minimal memory usage.*
* implement a Bloom filter from scratch in Java
* demonstrate hash functions and false positives
* optimize memory usage for large-scale filtering
* compare Bloom filter performance vs. HashSet
* simulate applications with real-world datasets
